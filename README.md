# LAN Vote
﻿a real-time voting app using node.js, socket.io, and AngularJS
﻿
﻿LAN Vote is the result of a problem I always had at LAN Parties. Everybody wanted to play something different and the only way to give everybody a "fair" chance was to pull names from a hat or something equally archaic. 
﻿
﻿In response to this problem I've created LANVote. Using realtime js library socket.io each vote instantly updates the results page which then fluidly animates the graph. I decided to make it a kind of game, sometimes the choices would move around, but the goal is always the same click as much as you can, as fast as you can.
